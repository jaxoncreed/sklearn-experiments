# Set Up
Install sklearn:
```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

Edit lines 78 and 79 of "run_all.py" to dictate the classifier and data set you'd like to test

Run the program:
```bash
python run_all.py
```

If you want, you can also check out the other python files which are very similar to run_all.py which is a unified file I made after realizing the tasks that needed to be done between each algorithm are very similar.
